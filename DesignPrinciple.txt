[OBJECT ORIENTED PRINCIPLES]
1.  Encapsulate what varies.
2.  Favor composition over inheritance.
2.  Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3.  Favor composition over inheritance.
4.  Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
5.  Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
6.  Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

[OBJECT ORIENTED PATTERNS]
[Strategy Pattern] - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently
from clients that use it.

[Observer Pattern] - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that
when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.

[Decorator Pattern] - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object
dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for
extending functionality.

[Factory Method Pattern] - Defines an interface for creating an object,
but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets
a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

[Abstract Factory Pattern] - Provides an interface for creating families of
related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

[Singleton Pattern] - Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a
global point of access to it.
